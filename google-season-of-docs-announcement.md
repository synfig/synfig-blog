# Documentation rework and Google Season of Docs

The upcoming release of Synfig 1.4.0 is brings a lot of changes, so we decided that it is a good moment to do a radical update of our documentation. As part of this effort we would like to migrate to Sphinx/ReadTheDocs format, which will make it easier to collaborate on writing and maintain quality of documentation.

This is a big work and to assist with this process we decided to apply for [Google Season of Docs program](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs). The goal of the program is to bring open source and technical writer communities together, to the benefit of both. 

It is not clear if we  get accepted or not, but in any case the process is started! If you are technical writer and interested to contribute - do not hesitate to contact us in [this forum thread]( https://forums.synfig.org/t/new-documentation/10931)
