# Transparent budget for Synfig

We have setup a page at OpenCollective in order to manage all donations and expences transparently.

OpenCollective is a transparent ledger service, which manages all financial transactions and publish information about them. 

That means:

- Everyone can see where the money come from, how much money collected, and how they are spent.
- Developers can easily submit invoices or receipts to get refunded for their work and other project-related expences.
- The process of paying to developers is transparent and handled by Open Source Collective 501(c)(6)
non-profit organization.
