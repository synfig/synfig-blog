Since 2013 Synfig has been supported with regular donations from many people, which helped to maintain its development and bring new features for benefit of everyone.

Now we are taking one more step towards improving our relationship with community by joining OpenCollective - a platform which will allow us to manage all donations and expences completely transparently.

OpenCollective provides a transparent ledger service and takes responsibility for managing all financial transactions, while keeping those process open for community.

That means:

- Everyone can see where the money come from, how much money collected, and how they are spent.
- Developers can easily submit invoices or receipts to get refunded for their work and other project-related expences.
- The process of paying to developers is transparent and handled by Open Source Collective 501(c)(6)
non-profit organization.
